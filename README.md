# ComicTrans

ComicTrans is the Translator for Foreign Comics ! To complete this complex task, we implemented both Machine Translation and Computer Vision techniques.

Given a source image of a page of a comic, called a "raw", we translate all the text to the language of the reader. This software has limitless potential. As our understanding of CV and MT continue, systems like ours can only improve, causing a revolution to the way we intake foreign media.

With a quick press of a button ("Clone Repo"), even you can have this power at the tip of your fingers.

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility.
